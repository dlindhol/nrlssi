The overall approach for calculating the solar spectral irradiance involves the 
parameterization of an observed irradiance time series at a given wavelength in terms of 
the proxy indicators needed to represent the known sources of variability at that 
wavelength. For wavelengths longer than 300 nm there are two main sources of 
variability, the dark sunspots and the bright faculae, which are represented by, 
respectively, the sunspot blocking function and the Mg index. For wavelengths from 
about 30 to 300 nm, the variations are primarily causes by emission from bright plages, 
approximately overlying the visible faculae, and the Mg index is used as a proxy for the 
sources of these variations. For the parameterizations of the shortest EUV and X-ray 
emissions (mainly at wavelengths below about 27 nm) the 10.7 cm radio flux is also used, 
in addition to the Mg index, to account for emission from hot coronal plasma overlying 
the bright plage.

Because the measurements of the solar spectral irradince have traditionally suffered from 
wavelength dependent degradation, the multiple regression that determines the 
association of the proxies with the observations is undertaken using detrended time series 
(both the proxies and the irradiance). In essence, this means that the associations are 
determined from a subset of the range of possible variations. The reconstruction of the 
irradiance from the proxy indicators (using the proxies themselves, i.e.., not detrended) 
therefore assumes that the proxies and the irradiance behave in similar ways over both 
rotational and solar cycle time scales. This direct multiple regression approach is applied 
to the wavelength range 120 to 300 nm using the UARS/SOLSTICE data and to the 
wavelength range 0 to 120 nm using the TIMED/SEE data. For wavelengths longer than 
300 nm, the spectral dependence of the variability is determined from the spectral 
dependence of the sunspot blocking and facular brightening. The total flux from 120 to 
100000 nm is constrained in absolute magnitude such that the total equals the actual 
bolometric observations of total solar irradince (modeled separately).
