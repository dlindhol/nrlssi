Subject: Re: sunspot blocking index for NRLSSI

Hi Marty - wow you are really on the ball with this - that is great.

So, here are the files that I use to calculate the SSB. The program is over 
ten years old so I am sure you can improve it programmatically!

I started to improve it myself in April this year (as part of NASA Glory and 
NOAA CDR work) but haven't finished yet - but since this version is what is 
used in the NRLSSI model to date this would be suitable for you to work with.

The IDL program reads in the Air Force multiple white light observations of 
sunspot regions. I've attached recent such files so you can get started - 
updates are at

ftp access
SOLAR_DATA
SUNSPOT_REGIONS
AUAF_MWL

The person to contact for queries is Bill Denig   wdenig <william.denig@noaa.gov>

The program also reads in a generic solar orientation file - the beta angle - 
and I've attached the file that I use for this too... you can probably improve 
this aspect to I suspect..

The program makes an output file of the sunspot blocking function for bolometric 
radiation and for UV radiation - file attached of that too. This is the file that 
the NRLSSI model then uses, together with the Mg index (which you HAVE!!).

So, why don't you see if you can get this program going, and then for the rest 
of the year we can each calculate our own SSB files and then compare them early 
next year. Meanwhile, I will try and get started on making the actual model 
program a bit more user friendly in order to send that to you too.

Let me know you have any questions, etc etc

Thanks for doing this! I am excited at the prospect of having this updated regularly on LISIRD!
