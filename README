  Cryptic developer notes as I try to understand the state of things.

calc_spotindex_Apr12.pro.ORIG
  Code used by Judith to process the sunspot blocking data from NOAA.
  Produces solar_b0.dat which is used as input to her model.

calc_spotindex_Apr12.pro
  Copy of Judith's code with my annotations.

data:

betasun.dat
  Solar beta angle given to us by Judith. 
  Used by calc_spotindex_Apr12.
  
solar_b0.dat
  My cleaned up version of betasun.dat that I never did much with.
  We should be able to reproduce her values. See _NOTES.


USAF_Denig_2010-2012.txt
  Given to us by Judith Lean.
