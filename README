Information about the specific contents of this project.

----
idl/orig:
  Original code that is largely obsolete but worth keeping for provenance.

	calc_spotindex_Apr12.pro.ORIG
	  Code used by Judith to process the sunspot blocking data from NOAA.
	
	calc_USAF_spotindex_Aug13.pro
	  Odele's modification of Judith's code.
	  Doug refactored this code into the routines in "sunspot".
	  
	nrl_2_tsi.pro.ORIG
	  Odele's original code to compute and write the TSI model.
	  Doug refactored this into the routines in "tsi".
	
	calc_NRLSSI_13Mar14.pro:
	  Judith's original code for computing the SSI model.
	  Doug refactored into "ssi".

idl/ssi:
  IDL routines to compute the solar spectral irradiance model, starting with calc_nrlssi.pro.

idl/sunspot:
  IDL code to compute sunspot blocking data, start with process_sunspot_blocking.pro.

idl/tsi:
  IDL code to compute the total solar irradiance model, starting with nrl_2_tsi.pro.

idl/util:
  IDL utility routines.
  
test:
  IDL test code.

USAF_Denig_2010-2012.txt
  Given to us by Judith Lean.
  Used in her Apr12 update.
  Apparently generated manually for her by Bill Denig.
  
----
docs:
  Various documentation, emails, papers that have informed the process. 
  Some are duplicates of information managed elsewhere but kept here for convenience.
  TODO: capture some of this on the wiki

denig_data_update_email_Mar2014:
  Email from Bill to Judith announcing updated versions of the sunspot data:
  http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/stp/space-weather/solar-data/solar-features/sunspot-regions/usaf_mwl/

TODO: describe source of other docs

_NOTES
  Cryptic developer notes as I try to understand the state of things.
  This should probably be digested into wiki docs and new issues.
