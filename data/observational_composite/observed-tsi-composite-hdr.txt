The Solar Irradiance Climate Data Record (CDR) (Coddington and Lean, 2015; 
Coddington et al., 2015) includes a composite observational record of total 
solar irradiance (TSI) constructed from space-based radiometer composite 
records between 1978 and 2014 and Total Irradiance Monitor (TIM) (Kopp et al. 
2005) observations after the launch of the SOlar Radiation and Climate 
Experiment (SORCE) (Rottman 2005). The prescribed observational composite is 
the average of two individual, composite records each constructed separately 
using different bias corrections and assumptions about the uncertainties and 
repeatability of the extant solar irradiance database and each first, 
separately normalized to the SORCE TIM absolute scale by regression analysis 
prior to the averaging. Frohlich and Lean (1998) describe the Physikalisch-
Meteorologisches Observatorium Davos (PMOD) composite and Willson and Mordvinov
(2003) the Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitor (ACRIM) composite. 

Then, the subset of the average record that overlaps in time with SORCE TIM is 
replaced by the TIM observations and the assigned uncertainty is that reported 
by SORCE TIM.  For the period of the record prior to the SORCE TIM epoch, the 
assigned uncertainties are equal to the differences in the PMOD and ACRIM 
composites (after their normalization to the SORCE TIM scale) plus an added 
value of 0.5 W m-2 that is the uncertainty of the SORCE TIM's absolute scale.
The Solar Irradiance CDR TSI observational composite will be extended in the 
future by appending TIM observations and their uncertainties.

Since exposure and time-dependent degradation is a challenging problem that 
requires refinements throughout the lifetime of a mission, the time period 
in the observational TSI composite comprised of TIM data will always trace to 
the most up-to-date record of the published instrument data. This composite was 
constructed from the following data versions:

SORCE TIM: 17
PMOD: 42_64_1410
ACRIM: 130329
